The security aspect is the highest concern of IoT connected entities. The data can be personal, enterprise or consumer. To reach an acceptable implementation for the smart door lock (SDL), security should be taken as a major challenge. 
The system should be secure and user-friendly. The main goal has been allocated to the following subgoals: 
 
➢	Constructing an architecture regarding the security and functionality. 
 
➢	Establishing a reliable technique to determine if a user is in the physical proximity of the door lock using Wi-Fi. 
 
➢	Attaining a proper policy to authenticate users trying to access the door.  
 
➢	Creating an android application that can serve as the user endpoint.
